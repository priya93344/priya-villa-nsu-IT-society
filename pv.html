Built around 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.
Mohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE. It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centers at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning.[13] When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned <br/>

The Indus Valley Civilisation, a.k.a the Harappan Civilisation, belonged to the bronze-age society that flourished on Indian soil from the 26 century BC. Considered one of the oldest civilizations in the world, these urban settlements seemed to stand out by virtue of their architectural and modern features like excellent civil engineering and well channelled drainage patterns. The town-planning of Harappans was one of their most notable features, and many such towns had great importance due to their craftsmanship and trade.he Indus Valley Civilisation, a.k.a the Harappan Civilisation, belonged to the bronze-age society that flourished on Indian soil from the 26 century BC.
